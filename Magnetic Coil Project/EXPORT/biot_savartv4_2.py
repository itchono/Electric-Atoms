B-field calculator using Biot-Savart law 

You will need to provide:
- series of points in (x, y, z, I) describing the geometry of a coil in a text file.
    - Each section of coil will have some amount of current flowing through it, in the forwards direction of the points in the coil.
    - The current in a given segment of coil is defined by the current listed at the starting point of the coil
    - Ex. P1------P2 is on our coil. The current P1 --> P2 is given by I1 (assuming P1 = (x1, y1, z1, I1))

- rectangular volume over which the fields need to be calculated
- resolution at which fields should be calculated
- all lengths in cm, B-field in G

version history:
    v2: Mingde Yin  May 31, 2020. Accelerated using numpy meshgrids
    v2.1: Jun 1, 2020. tkinter dialogs for opening & saving files. Defaults of 1 cm resolution in calculation.
    v3: Ryan Zazo  Jun 1, 2020. Plotting code integrated.
    v3.1: Minor cosmetic improvements to plot.
    v3.2: 3D plot of coil geometry.
    v3.3: Plotted B-fields together but code is long.
    v3.5: all B-field plots together
    v3.7: B-fields plotted together with 50 levels (now works on windows) and combined v3.3 and v3.5
    v3.8: Changed up all np.aranges to np.linspaces and changed up the plotting code to work with non-integer step sizes and non-integer levels
    v4: Mingde Yin June 9, 2020 Using Richardson Extrapolation for midpoint rule to improve accuracy (5 to 30x better at 1.4x speed penalty), tweaked linspaces to correctly do step size
    v4.1: Minor change in function indexing to use more numpy, cleaning up for export
    v4.2: Changed the linspaces a bit to make everything more symmetric

wishlist:
    1. improve plot_coil with different colors for different values of current?
    2. improve plot_fields to reduce space between Bz plot and colorbar ---- done

EXTERNAL USAGE

Import all functions in this file

- The coil will load in from the selected file
- You must then slice the coil
- You must then produce a Target Volume using the coil
- Then, you can either use getFieldVector(), or index on your own

- If you are indexing on your own, remember to account for the offset (starting point), and spatial resolution
- something like <relativePosition = ((np.array(position) - np.array(startpoint)) / volumeresolution).astype(int)>
